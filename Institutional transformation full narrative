# Expanded Narrative for Institutional Transformation as a Cross-Cutting Issue

Current global food systems will undergo significant changes in order to achieve universal food security by 2050.  These changes will involve and affect all actors / agents, regardless of sector, that operate within food systems, as well as the resources at their disposal.  Certainly public universities with their tripartite missions of teaching, research, and engagement are essential actors / agents AND resources within these food systems.  As such, institutional transformation will be a watchword on campuses worldwide in the push for universal food security.

The prompt for institutional transformation will be for those who are food insecure to have a clear and consistent _voice_ that makes their situations known throughout food systems; a visible _presence_ that sparks co-learning events / experiments among food systems actors / agents and their available resources; and an unwavering _passion_ that leads to practical approaches and discernible changes in the roles and relationships among actors / agents in the food systems necessary to sustain those solutions.  

[Digital infrastructure](http://reports.weforum.org/delivering-digital-infrastructure/introduction-the-digital-infrastructure-imperative/ "Delivering digital infrastructure") is the primary means by which a vast majority of actors / agents in food systems can exercise their voice, presence, and passion and, in so doing, initiate systems change processes / theory of change that drives institutional transformation.

Digital infrastructure catalyzes these change processes by precipitating an extensive range of accessible, interconnected forums wherein participants engage one another in myriad "conversations that matter".  As a result of these exchanges, participants gain a wider awareness and appreciation of "ways that work" within given contexts and consider how to apply that knowledge and know-how elsewhere.  They also build portfolios of participatory research projects that attract resources to test alternatives and determine what else may work better, learn from those experiences, and apply the knowledge and know-how gained to adopt "changes that sustain" within food system actors / agents.

2050 Commission members can take actions NOW with readily available / accessible digital infrastructure that will move the world closer to the goal of universal food security by 2050:

1. Take advantage of [social media platforms]([Global%20Social%20Media%20Research%20Summary%202016] "social media platform usage") to create interconnected public Facebook Groups and Google+ Communities related to "The Challenge of Change"
2. Invite open participation by Facebook and Google+ members to repurpose global food systems so they yield universal food security by 2050.
3. Seed the "Conversations that Matter" for those groups and communities with leading questions based on the template provided by [Global Knowledge Initiative (GKI)](http://www.globalknowledgeinitiative.org/about-us/index.html "global knowledge initiative"): 
	 - Why is this important?
	 - How might we?
	 - What's stopping us?
4. Review Google and Facebook analytics about  activities underway in the forums
5. Utilize Twitter feeds to draw more attention to the content generated within the forums
6. Disseminate knowledge and know-how about ways that work more broadly through YouTube videos
7. Encourage people to use their phones, wearables, implants on their person as well as devices, vehicles, buildings, etc. within the [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "internet of things") as proactive and powerful sensors that have the capacity to amplify and extend their voice, presence, and passion, influence actors / agents throughout food systems, and improve their circumstances with food security
8. Charter projects / submit proposals for the further development of algorithms / machine learning / artificial intelligence to better convert data into information and knowledge
9. Promote contests to develop games / virtual reality / [man-machine integration (MMI)](https://peerj.com/preprints/2402/ "The man-machine integration era")_Â
